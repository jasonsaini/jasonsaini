===========
I've had an interest in tech since I was 5, when my parents bought me my first video game system. 
Since then, I've always been amazed by the capability and development of modern technology. 

My specific interests have ranged from developing LEGO robots in the 8th grade to writing automated SMS scripts in high school. 

It was only natural that I doubled down on this interest by pursuing computer science nearly 13 years later. 
I've recently added a finance minor to my degree to help develop my intellectual capacity for money management and theory.

Now, I'm seeking to work at impactful companies that have the power to enable positive change through tech. I've already made a few humble impacts in the tech space. 

Some of my highlights include helping my peers learn computer science fundamentals as an SI Leader at my school, contributing to enterprise-level solutions as an intern, and helping grow the ACM chapter by managing money and leading developmental workshops.

Aside from tech, I'm an avid Marvel fan, seasoned gamer, dog lover, and coffee enthusiast!
